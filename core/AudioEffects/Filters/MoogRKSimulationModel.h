/*
Imitates a Moog resonant filter by Runge-Kutte numerical integration of
a differential equation approximately describing the dynamics of the circuit.

Useful references:
	* Tim Stilson
	"Analyzing the Moog VCF with Considerations for Digital Implementation"
		Sections 1 and 2 are a reasonably good introduction but the
		model they use is highly idealized.
	* Timothy E. Stinchcombe
	"Analysis of the Moog Transistor Ladder and Derivative Filters"
		Long, but a very thorough description of how the filter works including
		its nonlinearities
	* Antti Huovilainen
	"Non-linear digital implementation of the moog ladder filter"
		Comes close to giving a differential equation for a reasonably realistic
		model of the filter
The differential equations are:
	y1' = k * (S(x - r * y4) - S(y1))
	y2' = k * (S(y1) - S(y2))
	y3' = k * (S(y2) - S(y3))
	y4' = k * (S(y3) - S(y4))
where k controls the cutoff frequency, r is feedback (<= 4 for stability), and S(x) is a saturation function.
